__Task 1__

Created an instance and installed apache. In security group, allowed all traffic for both inbound and outbound.  
Screenshot 1: Security group details
Screenshot 2: Website loading from the instance 

Removed outbound rules from the security group.
Screenshot 3: Security group details
Screenshot 4: Website still loading from the instance 

Added allow all traffic to outbound of the security group. 
Created NACL - my-NACL. Associated new NACL with the subnet containing the existing EC2 instance. 
Screenshot 5: my-NACL -> subnet association
Screenshot 6: EC2 details including subnet info

Added rule #100 in my-NACL outbound section to allow all traffic. 
Added rule #200 in my-NACL inbound section to allow SSH from my ip.
Added rule #300 in my-NACL inbound section to allow HTTP from my ip.
Screenshot 7: my-NACL > inbound section 

Deleted my-NACL after removing association with the subnet. The subnet is now associated with the default NACL.

# 28 nov 2022



create instance 
install website 



task 1 - created instance with sample data.

screenshot: instance details from console 
screenshot: website loading from instance 


task 2 - add the existing instance to an Auto Scaling Group
To achieve this - 
create an AMI: webserver-ami
create Launch configuration to launch instances identical to existing EC2: webserver-lc
create ASG: webservver-asg; min-0, max-1, desired-0 : to create an empty ASG and add existing EC2 to ASG; AZs- ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b; no load balancer; health check grace period: 120s; 
attach instance to ASG
update min value to 1 in ASG

screenshot: instance description - autoscaling group info
screenshot: ASG instance management tab
screenshot: ASG activity history


task 3 - set instance from ASG to standby mode

screenshot: error message when trying to lower the number of instances below min without opting for `Add a new instance to the Auto Scaling group to balance the load`

change min value to 0 and then move instance from ASG to standby mode 

screenshot: instance in standby mode

stop and start instance 
move instance from standby to `in service`

screenshot: instance is in service under ASG instance management 


task 4 - detach ec2 from ASG. Once detached, EC2 will not be managed by ASG. 

screenshot: instance management - no instances as of now

deleted ASG and LC, instance is still intact


task 5 - rename ec2 instance name to shopping-application-template 
create ami: shopping-application-version1-ami
create lc: shopping-application-version1-lc
create asg: shopping-application-asg; desired capacity - 2

screenshot: instance management under ASG
screenshot: instances in console 

create elb: shopping-application-elb
connection draining: 5sec
edit asg and attach load balancer 
alias the domain to load balancer 

screenshot: instances in load balancer 

URL: https://shopping.amaldeep.tech/


task 6 - update website code to next version - version 2.0 
create ami: shopping-application-version2-ami
create lc: shopping-application-version2-lc
update launch configuration in ASG 
updated tags in ASG for EC2 

proceeding with rolling update by terminating each instances with old version

screenshot: ec2 console 
screenshot: activity history from ASG 


task 7 - update code to version 3
create ami: shopping-application-version3-ami
create lc: shopping-application-version3-lc
update launch configuration in ASG 
update termination policy to oldest launch configuration
in clb, updata sticky session 
in asg, updated desired capacity to 4 
now there are 2 version2 instances and 2 version3 instances 

screenshot: ec2 console with 2 version2 and 2 version3 instances

downgrade desired capacity to 2 with updated termination policy
