has issues when working with lists. if order of list elements are modified, count will have to create the resources 
reources are linked to index order of count. so index order has changed, resource will be recreated 
subnets[0].id
subnets[1].id

array and count should not used together
* use array with for_each 
* count loops based on a number
* for_each loops over an array/map


# Types of array
* set - values cannot be repeated
* list - values can be repeated
* tuple 

* Only set of strings or map can be used in for_each 
* toset() - convert list to set  - only list?

> In list(string), numbers will be converted to string
